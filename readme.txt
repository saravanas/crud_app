Situation
You are a senior software engineer tasked with developing 
a Python-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. 
This application needs to follow best practices for data management, 
have a clean architecture, and be maintainable for future development.

Task
Design and implement a complete CRUD application in Python that 
allows users to create, read, update, and delete data records. 
Include all necessary components such as data models, storage mechanisms, 
error handling, and a user interface (command-line or simple web interface).

Objective
To create a robust, well-structured CRUD application that demonstrates 
proper software engineering principles, efficient data handling, and 
follows Python best practices. The application should be functional, 
maintainable, and serve as a foundation that could be extended with 
additional features in the future.

Knowledge

The application should include proper separation of concerns (data access layer, 
business logic, presentation layer)
Implement appropriate error handling and input validation
Include documentation (comments, docstrings, and a README)
Consider using appropriate design patterns
Implement proper logging
Include basic unit tests to verify functionality
Use appropriate data storage (SQLite, JSON files, or another simple storage solution)
Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
